# storskegg.org

Personal site. Ultimately will contain photo galleries, general writing, basic "about me" shit, and blogging. It'll link
to my resume, too.

Since this site will be a place where, at least to some extent, I wear myself on my sleeve (as thought I'm capable of
anything else), some of the content will not be suitable for hiring managers, HR representatives, head hunters, etc,
due in part to its potential for discrimination. I'll also need a means of tracking agreement, which also means the use
of the dreaded "cookie use policy."

# Getting Started

Dev on windows isn't currently supported due to some tooling that sugars the dev side of things.

For now, I'm assuming you're using macos and homebrew.

## Tooling

### Overmind

This handy tool uses the Procfile to run the parcel watcher _and_ the dev server with a single command.

`brew install overmind`

### Fresh

This dead project is the best I've seen for watching go files, and restarting the server. Unfortunately it's no longer
maintained.

`go install github.com/pilu/fresh@latest`
